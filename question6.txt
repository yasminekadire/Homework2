From Question3, what issues you might obtain during the development of the program?
What issues do you think will happen if some of the actions,
e.g., waking up the ATC, checking the traffic pattern, entering the traffic
pattern, diverging to another airport, etc., take time to finish? 
And what will be a potential solution for the issues?


While developing this program, there was a problem with having the runway full but eventually clearing out to receive more planes.
I used a counter to add planes to the runway and subtract them some time afterwards to simulate the plane clearing the runway.
This just led to adding and subtracting the same plane as it landed and never got to simulate a busy runway.
If some of the actions were not instantaneous, the traffic pattern would take a very long time to clear and most airplanes would be redirected.
Overall, the program would take a very long time to run through all 10 airplanes.
A potential solution would be to allow more planes on the runway at once.
