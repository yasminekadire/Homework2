From Question2, 
what issues may happen if the robot that finished the task is assigned a new task immediately? 
And what will be a potential solution for the issues?

If the robot finishes the task and immediately starts a new task without putting down its tools, 
the two robots surrounding the robot will never be able to start their tasks.
The solution to this could be providing more tools for the robots. 
To stop the robot from starting a new task immediately, you should add a condition to return the tools and not be the first robot to touch either tool again.
